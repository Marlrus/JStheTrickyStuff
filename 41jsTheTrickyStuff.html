                        "this" is a reserved keyword in JS, this means that you can not set it as the value of any variable. The value of "this" is determined by <em>how</em> a function is called, know as <em>execution context</em>. Can be determined using 4 rules (global,object/implicit,explicit,new).

                        When "this" is called outside of a function, it refers to the global object. In the case of a browser that is the <em>window</em> object. Any time we call "this" outside of a declared object, it refers to the global object. Even if we run it inside a function with no object, it will return the global object. We don't want to accidentally create variables in the global object, whcih is pretty easy to do by mistake. If we run a function with <code>this.keyName = value</code> and run it, we would have added that variable to the global scope. To avoid this mistake, we can use ES5's <code>"use strict"</code> on the top of your code, which makes this inside functions "undefined" when not inside a declared object. Therefore when we run these functions we will get an error as we cannot attach a value to undefined. Play around using quokka and the file <a href="./1globalContext.js" target="_blank">1globalContext.js</a>.

                        We used the person object with the nested dog object. We ran the function that returned undefined because this was referring to the dog object and added call() <code>console.log(person.dog.sayHello.call(person))</code> this returned what we wanted: "Hello Colt". We can do that to any function that uses this and alter the context of this for that function. In the second example we created two objects: colt and elie. Each of them had a sayHi method inside that returned Hi and the this.firstName value inside each object. We removed the method from "elie" but called it using the elie object as context through <code>colt.sayHi.call(elie)</code> which ran the method inside colt using elie as a context and returned "Hi Elie".

We create a function, addNumbers that takes 4 parameters and returns a message using this.firstName and adding the 4 parameters. We change the name using call first with <code>.call(elie,1,2,3,4)</code> and then using add with <code>.add(elie,[1,2,3,4])</code> and we get the same return: "Elie just calculated 10"

This will return addNumbers() but with elie set as the context of "this". We don't need to know all the arguments of a function up front, this is called <em><u>partial application</u></em> In our example, addNumbers(a,b,c,d) takes 4 arguments. We can set bind without the full parameters: <code>var elieCalc2 = colt.addNumbers.bind(elie,1,2)</code> which will bind the context "this" on ellieCalc2 to "elie". This is the <em>MANDATORY</em> param in this function. We can set all 4 params or none and still call it. In our case we call <code>elieCalc(3,4)</code> which returns "Ellie just calculated 10" because it took params a and b from the declaration and c and d from the application.

                        <strong>NOTE:</strong> setTimeout() is a method in <em><u>the global object</u></em> that lets us postpone the execution of some code by a set amount of ms. <code>setTimeout(codeToPostpone,ms)</code> While the code is being ran our code is not blocked.

                        We create a setTimeout() inside the colt.sayHi() that logs our "Hi this.firstName" that sends the log 1000ms after the execution. This is tricky because "this" does not refer to the colt object, it refers to the <em>global object</em> because setTimeout is the function being executed, and its parent object is <em>the global object</em> the context of this is the global object. To solve this we can explicitly set what we want the keyword "this" to refer to.

                        We could use call or apply, however since we want to call this function in a later point in time we don't want to call either of those. Since they invoke immediately, it would defeat the purpose. For our purpose, we use the colt object and modify the sayHi function to execute setTimeout with an internal function that does a console.log() that uses this. This will use the global context for "this" as we saw previously, however we add .bind(this) <code>setTimeiout(function(){}.bind(this),1000)</code> this will set the "this" to a different scope. In our case, since the .bind(this) has the colt object as its parent, it will use the colt object to target "this". We could also use .bind(colt) but having (this) would make it more dynamic.

                        "this" is a reserved keyword in JS and its value is determined at execution. It is set using the global context. When set in the global context in a function it refers to the global object (window in a browser). If inside an object, it will always use the closest parent object as context. We can explicitly set the value of "this" using call(), apply(), or bind() (can only be attached to functions). When a function is used with the keyword "new", which creates a new object, this refers to the object that was created.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming model based around the idea of objects and blueprints that make objects. These blueprints are called "classes". We call objects created from classes "instances". We strive to make our classes abstract and modular so that we can reuse them easily and share them amongst other parts of the program. *JS did not have "classes" built into it at the time of this video.* To mimic this we use functions and objects.

                        This is the function that is used as a blueprint for what each object should be. Convention has it that constructor functions are Capitalized. <strong>new</strong> must be used with a function or we will get a type error. The first thing "new" does is create an empty object. Second, it sets the keyword "this" to be that empty object. Third, it adds the line <code>return this</code> to the end of the function. Fourth, it adds a property onto the empty object called "__proto__"(Double underscores on each side commonly known as "dunder") which links the prototype property on the constructor function to the empty object (more later). We do an exercise that creates a constructor for dog with name, age, and a function bark that logs "dogName just barked". The result is in the file 8constructors.

                        We have two constructors, one for Car and one for Motorcycle, they are very similar and you want to use the same code inside both of them. We do this by refactoring using call+apply. We have the Car constructor which takes 3 arguments and has a fixed this.numWheels value. We make a Motorcycle constructor that has the same 3 arguments but numWheels is different. To refactor this we can call the Car constructor inside the Motorcycle constructor to fill in the first 3 arguments. However, if we run Car inside Motorcycle we would need to pass the arguments used in our Motorcycle constructor. We use <code>Car.call(this,make,model,year)</code> inside our Motorcycle constructor. We can invoke the Car constructor, however the keyword "this" inside car is not the "this" we want it to use. Therefore we set it as the first parameter of .call(). We change the "this" context of Car from the this of the Car function, and set it to the object created when we invoke <code>new Motorcycle</code> Using "this" will achieve that because when we run <code>var motorcycle1 = new Motorcycle("Ducati","Scrambler","2017")</code> the "new" keyword places the this for everything inside the Motorcycle function as motorcycle1.

                        <strong>Using apply() and "arguments"</strong>
                        <br>
                        So we refactored using call() and we reused the Car constructor in our code. We can use apply() which has the same first argument that sets the this context, but it takes an array as a second argument instead of individual arguments. We just alter the code to <code>Car.apply(this, [make,model,year])</code> which will take the arguments we pass and pass them as an array foru apply(). The final refactor is using the <em><strong>arguments</strong></em> keyword. Arguments takes the arguments of a function and turns them into an array with a couple of more things. Using <code>Car.apply(this, arguments)</code> the constructor will take the arguments and transform them into an array we can pass into the Car.apply() function. Since we are not using the arguments for anything, we can also remove them from our declaration to <code>function MotorcycleAppArg(){</code>. <strong>Note:</strong> all of the functions where called using <code>var varName = new functionName("value1","value2","value3")</code> and then logged with <code>console.log(varName)</code>
